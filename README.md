# matcha_sub

Matcha is a your typical dating site. The site was written in PHP, HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of Javascript. MYSQL was used to store the data.

Wanna run it?
Make sure you have a web server solution like XAMPP, MAMP or WAMP.
Clone the repo in htdocs.
Open the config folder, and edit the setup.php file. 
Do the same for the database.php file. Then put your details to access the database.

In the repo, you will find a mysql file. Import it into your db. That's if you would like to generate a lot of users.
Otherwise, enjoy.

I have also included a technical report on the project, if you would like to know more about it.
